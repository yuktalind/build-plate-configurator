We're building a minimal product configurator with live 3d visualization for an ebay vendor offering precision cnc'd build plates.

You must check this listing before proceeding with anything: https://www.ebay.de/itm/127401554779

We have an index.html as a starting point, but it's untested. get that thing up into its own repo first and let's see it public on github pages. only then we'll proceed with refinements.

Rules:
1. NO emojis. Ever. The spec.md for example is infected with them. I am a man above the age of 30. I have zero tolerance for emojis. Remove them where you encounter them, without me needing to remind you.

2. We develop locally, I verify each step in my browser locally. You provide me witht he url. If https is needed for some reason, then I suppose the easier way is to deploy to github pages directly and supply me with the link.

3. We never mention the vendor or my intention to make a good first impression on him by granting him something for free ever, anywhere. This is just a project that arises from my own personal need to visualize the options he offers. I suspect he might see use in it and I'll be happy to exchange my expertise with his in that case.

4. Never celebrate success on an untested assumption that your commit is actually working and hitting the business goal. simply refrain from any celebratory ejaculations and instead remain sceptical of your own work. for now, you are the developer, i'll be your tester. we celebrate when i say success, not before that.

5. We never commit any .md files until we have a proper concise README.md ready to commit. that'll be the only md we'll ever commit.


Now, after all this this intro, please refer to spec.md.
